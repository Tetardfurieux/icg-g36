Textures
----------------------
This part was well explained and straight forward to implement.


Environment mapping
----------------------
We had trouble understanding how the mat4.perspective works.
The CUBE_FACE_UP part wasn't complicated to implement.


Environment capture
--------------------
For the environment capture, the only tricky part was using the "reflect" function, and the rest was similar to the previous labs.  


Shadow Mapping
--------------------
This part was really challenging. We had trouble implementing the color in phong_shadow.frag


Adding the light contributions
--------------------
The documentation was easy to read, finding the right values was feasible.

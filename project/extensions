Use the 2D variant of the wave function collapse to generate the city (or the terrain) procedurally.


Have at least four sets of types of tiles that can be combined in this algorithm (grass, tree, sand, water) and their respective adjacency probabilities (ex, canâ€™t have a tree tile next to a sand tile, or no grass next to the water, or 50/50 to have sand or tree next to grass).
Extensions (clamped to 5.5)

[+1] Extend the wave function collapse algorithm to work in 3D -> blocks can now be added vertically

[+0.5] Add more tiles (at least 4)

[+1] Generate textures using wave collapse

[+1] Interactive generation (ex. Clicking to add or remove tiles)

[+0.5] Online generation of an infinite scene as the camera is scrolling

[+0.5] Day-night cycle

[+0.5] Animations
